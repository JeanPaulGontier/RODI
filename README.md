# RODI

You are welcome to join us on https://www.rodi-platform.org/ ! You can check out the news about Rodi and meet the founders and Most Valuable Professionals
around the project. And if you're involved enough, you could be party of them !

First of all, this project is developped in order to be used with DotNetNuke. To use correctly RODI, you must download DotNetNuke. Then you have to copy the folder "web" where your DNN website has been created and register all modules.

Use SQL Server Managment Studio to create tables with database.sql script.

If you want a complete access to the code, you should buy an Aspose licence. We're using this library in the code so you won't be able to use modules which are using it.

Thank you for using RODI and making it better!
